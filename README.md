<h1>100 Python Projects</h1>
<p>
This project was made in the intent of sharpening my programming ability in Python. It also helped me develop more general skills such as problem solving and adaptability. <br>
I followed the "<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/">100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023"</a> <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">udemy</a> course.
